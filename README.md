Mark Pavel's Portfolio

## Description
This page is my portfolio. Built in HTML and CSS, I believe it shows off my personality in my style, while also showcasing my abilities as a developer.

## Deployment
https://programmingastorm.github.io/MarkPavelPortfolio/

# DISCLAIMER
The following deployment is the MVP and is still VERY WIP. It's barely responsive and works best on chrome with a display of 1920 x 1080. Otherwise, alignment of things is not guaranteed to look good or even be working.
